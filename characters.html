                The son of George Joestar I, Jonathan is an honest, kind and positive man whose life is fraught with tragedy after meeting his adopted older brother, Dio Brando. 
                In his battle against Dio, Jonathan becomes a Ripple user under the tutelage of the master Will Anthonio Zeppeli. <br>
                Jonathan was proud and mischievous, yet gentle. Despite already aspiring to be a "true gentleman",
                Jonathan lacked manners and mostly behaved like a normal child.<br>
                First and foremost, Jonathan strives to become his definition of a "true gentleman" as he carries his Joestar name with pride, 
                never betraying the code of conduct he has set for himself and will treat any fellow human with respect unless they prove evil. <br>
                Jonathan fights for what he believes in, and once he is committed to something, he won't back down until the deed is done. <br>
                As a gentleman, Jonathan is also kind and positive. Jonathan has a mindset where he tries to imagine the consequences his actions would have on other people, 
                even if they appear to be enemies. <br>
                Even after everything Dio has done, Jonathan still considers him his brother, and sheds tears for him. <br>

                    Dio Brando, known as DIO from Part 3 onwards, is the main antagonist of Part 1 and Part 3. <br>
                    After becoming a vampire and later a Stand user, 
                    Dio has gathered around him many minions and is responsible for many major events of the series, 
                    from the death of Jonathan Joestar to the Joestar Family's sudden acquisition of Stand power, and his legacy persists throughout the series. <br>
                    Dio is the father of Giorno Giovanna, the protagonist of Part 5, as well as a handful of other illegitimate offspring.‎ <br>
                    Dio is consistently manipulative and violently domineering, and has repeatedly shown a lack of conscience and empathy. <br>
                    Dio's most recognizable characteristics are his boundless ambition and his love of power. Abused by his father, being underpriviledged and 
                    having lived in the most miserable living conditions, Dio set for himself the goal of becoming the richest, then the most powerful being on Earth. <br>
                    Dio enjoys being in a position of power and has repeatedly stated how great he felt being in a dominating position. <br>
                    On the contrary, Dio never tolerated that someone could stand up to him or equal him in power, and was enraged and deeply disturbed at the thought several times.<br>

                <div class="CharacterName">William Anthonio Zeppeli</div>
                <img class="CharacterLeft" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/jjba/images/7/76/WilliamA.png/revision/latest?cb=20161028235627">

                    Will Anthonio Zeppeli, also known as Baron Zeppeli, is Jonathan Joestar's primary ally in Phantom Blood. <br>
                    Zeppeli is a Ripple master hailing from Italy who searches for the Stone Mask to destroy it. <br> 
                    Hearing about Dio Brando, he thus becomes Jonathan's mentor and teaches him in the art of the Ripple as well as fights alongside him. <br>
                    Will Anthonio Zeppeli is a fearless but eccentric Ripple master dedicated to battle evil. <br>
                    Zeppeli shows himself as a fairly quirky individual. <br>
                    Moreover, he shows a number of other small eccentricities such as gratuitously jumping high with his legs crossed, having a tendency to pepper his snack too much,
                    or bringing a wine bottle without the corkscrew and ultimately piercing its bottom to get to the wine. <br>
                    As a master of the Ripple, Zeppeli is confident and brave, notably thinking that one's courage is proportional to the hardships one faces. <br>
                    Zeppeli is a righteous individual dedicated to battle evil. <br>
                    After surviving a Vampire attack, Zeppeli spent the rest of his life to investigate the Stone Mask and then learn the Ripple to battle its vampiric spawns.<br>

                <p>
                    Robert E. O. Speedwagonis a major ally featured in Phantom Blood and is a minor ally in Battle Tendency.<br>
                    Robert is a hot-blooded and honorable street thug and later businessman. <br>
                    Despite his activity as a hoodlum, Speedwagon is a righteous man. 
                    Due to his ability to "smell out" the personality of people, he had recognized Jonathan's noble spirit. <br>
                    Speedwagon is incredibly loyal to his friends, befriending Jonathan was in part due to the gentleman being kind to his partners in crime. <br>
                    He will try to do anything to help them, and even after Jonathan's death, Speedwagon remained friends with Erina out of respect for Jonathan. <br>
                    Speedwagon takes care of Erina and Joseph Joestar much like a father figure or close uncle.<br>
                    Apart from that, Speedwagon is both anxious and hot-blooded. He is very extroverted and loudly conveys his feelings, 
                    from enthusiastically describing Jonathan fighting, to his despair at seeing Kars become the Ultimate Lifeform. <br>
                    Speedwagon constantly seeks to help his companions in various more or less convoluted ways. <br>
